  DESCRIPTION
  -----------
  sf2a  is a unix command-line program 
  for creating sound files from text such as
 
       moderato: do re mi.

   - We have renamed sf2sound to be sf2a.
   - The installer (for Macs) is now "sudo sh setup.sh -install"
   - All files are installed in /Applications/sf2a/


  INSTALLATION & TESTING
  ----------------------
  Install sf2a by running the command

       % sudo sh setup.sh -install YOUR_USER_NAME

  in the downloaded folder.
  Then run this to test the installation

       sf2a 'do re mi'

  The audio file produced is out.wav

  DICTATION
  --------
  Copy the file dictation.txt from the install folder to some folder.
  Go to that folder.  Run the command 

      % dict -m

  The file dictation.txt will be processed into web page
  that has five musical dictation exercises.   Still
  some work to do here.  Type dict -h for help.

  We have started a manual. See sf2a.tex
