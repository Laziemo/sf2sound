sf2sound is a unix command-line program 
for creating sound files from text such as
 
     moderato: do re mi.

This is a collabarative project:

  James Carlson, Hakon Hallgrimur
  
--------------
Example 1. (input from command line)

	%  /.solfa2sf phrase '|| q do re . e mi re do re | mi x fa x h sol ||' 
	% play phrase.wav

Here "play" is any program capable of playing .wav files.

Example 2: As above, excep that the contents of nthe fie are read from disk.

    % /.solfa2sf -f theme.txt 
    % play theme.wav

For theme.txt -- see this github: http://gitub.com/jxxcarlson/sf2sound/  .

The sound file theme.wav for various versions of sf2sound
can be found at http://hhallgrimur.wordpress.com/code/

Parts:

  1. sf2sound.py
  2. quad2samp.c
  3. text2sf

Parts 1 and 2 are in this repository.  Part 3 comes 
with "The Audio Programming Book" by Boulanger
and Lazzarini.  Later, I will try to find a 
source for it on the internet.

For sf2sound to have access to parts 2 and 3, the 
following variables in sf2sound.py must be set

# Location of text2sf and quad2samp in system:
TEXT2SF = "~/Dropbox/bin/text2sf"
QUAD2SAMP = "~/Dropbox/bin/quad2samp"

Search the text of sf2sound.py for these.
