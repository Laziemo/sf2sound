NOTE: we have renamed sf2sound to be sf2a.

sf2a  is a unix command-line program 
for creating sound files from text such as
 
     moderato: do re mi.

After installing the package using 

     install2.sh -install

run

     sf2a 'do re mi'

Then listen to the audio file out.wav

We have started a manual. See sf2a.tex
or go to 

     http://www.math.utah.edu/~carlson/audio/sf2a.pdf


This is a collabarative project:

-------------
NOTE:  We have posted a new version of sf2sound
which has a much more modular structure.  It is
not quite up to date with the previous version.

To install version 1, use sh install1.sh.
To install version 2, use 

  sh install2.sh -install

For tests and examples of version 2, use

  sh install2.sh -test
  sh install2.sh -test2

The files required for version 2 are
listed below.  The file ui.py
is the "main" file.

   driver.py
   sf2a.py
   SFM.py
   note.py
   scales.py
   rhythm.py
   dynamics.py
   parse.py
   comment.py
   stringUtil.py
   stack.py
   ring.py
   melody.py
   listUtil.py
   ui.py
   dict.py

  --------------
Example 1. (input from command line)

	% /.sf2a '|| q do re . e mi re do re | mi x fa x h sol ||' 
	% play out.wav

Here "play" is any program capable of playing .wav files.

Example 2: As above, except that the contents of the file are read from disk.

        % /.sf2a -f theme.txt 	 
        % play theme.wav

For theme.txt -- see this github: http://gitub.com/jxxcarlson/sf2sound/  .

The sound file theme.wav for various versions of sf2sound
can be found at http://hhallgrimur.wordpress.com/code/

---------------------

Parts that are compiled with C

        1. mix.c
        2. quad2samp.c
        3. text2sf

Parts 1 and 2 are in this repository.  Part 3 comes 
with "The Audio Programming Book" by Boulanger
and Lazzarini.  Later, I will try to find a 
source for it on the internet.

For sf2sound to have access to parts 2 and 3, two
variables in sf2sound.py must be set --
TEXT2SF and  QUAD2SAMP, e.g.,

         # Location of text2sf and quad2samp in system:
         TEXT2SF = "~/Dropbox/bin/text2sf"
         QUAD2SAMP = "~/Dropbox/bin/quad2samp"

Search the text of sf2sound.py for these.
