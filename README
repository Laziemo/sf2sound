sf2sound is a unix command-line program 
for creating sound files from text such as
 
     moderato: do re mi.

This is a collabarative project:

  James Carlson, Hakon Hallgrimur

-------------
Parts:

  1. sf2sound.py
  2. quad2samp.c
  3. text2sf

Parts 1 and 2 are in this repository.  Part 3 comes 
with "The Audio Programming Book" by Boulanger
and Lazzarini.  Later, I will try to find a 
source for it on the internet.

For sf2sound to have access to parts 2 and 3, the 
following variables in sf2sound.py must be set

# Location of text2sf and quad2samp in system:
TEXT2SF = "~/Dropbox/bin/text2sf"
QUAD2SAMP = "~/Dropbox/bin/quad2samp"

Search the text of sf2sound.py for these.
